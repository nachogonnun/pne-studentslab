For result 1 the main program works well.
For result 2 we have a ZeroDivision Error that comes from t1, because the numbers inside the function g(c, d) are the same (3, 3) which transforms t1 in 0.
For result 3 and result 4 the main program also works well because there is now a division by zero because c and d are different (the same as in result 1).
